                <p>
                  Gone are the days when ‘over the counter’ was the only means
                  available for the customer to interact with the enterprise. In
                  the mid-nineties Computer telephony Integration enabled
                  customers to reach out to enterprises through call centres.
                  With the advent of social media there are multiple channels
                  for the customer for interacting with the customer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the ways and means of accessing an enterprise grew in
                  variety and reach, the ‘power to contact’ shifted to the
                  consumers. With the advent of newer digital channels such as
                  chat, emails, social media platforms, the customer now decides
                  the time and manner of communication. However, integrating
                  these channels and allowing customers to interact with
                  multiple channels yet have the context maintained across all
                  touch points has been a big challenge for enterprises.

                  to reach out to the customers through these new channels.
                  However the meteoric rise of social media has made it very
                  complex for the marketing professionals in the customer
                  centric organizations to provide orchestrated communication
                  across each and every channel in the customer engagement
                  process. We Network in association with our principals Servion

                <h5>SERVER VIRTUALISATION</h5>
                <p>
                  Server technology is evolving rapidly but the information
                  processing requirements in every organization is growing even
                  faster. In this scenario Virtualisation is an exciting
                  business prospect. Not only does it provide substantially
                  lower operational costs and increased business agility, there
                  is also no danger of compromising your security and business
                  operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We aim to make virtualization as easy as possible to
                  understand, design and deploy. Here, in a nutshell, is what we
                  could do for you. Server virtualization can dramatically
                  reduce the number of physical servers in your business. This
                  is done by enabling multiple “virtual servers” to be run on a
                  single, or reduced, number of machines. Each virtual server
                  has its own operating system and applications are run with
                  users having access via the network as normal. These multiple
                  virtual servers are managed via a single management layer, or
                  “hypervisor”.
                </p>
                <h5>STORAGE VIRTUALIZATION</h5>
                <p>
                  With storage virtualisation, storage capacity is completely
                  removed from the insecticidal user or server. Instead, it is
                  deployed in a single or shared pool. Storage capacity is
                  allocated to, and accessed by, the user or server via the
                  network and can be adjusted to meet demand at any given time.
                  Proactively managed by the IT team, disk space can be fully
                  utilised without wastage. The result? Capacity planning, data
                  classification by importance, backup and restore, and
                  peak-time balancing all become easier.
